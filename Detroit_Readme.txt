Select a set of at least five locations within a city or metropolitan area. Create at least eight maps illustrating the accessibility of those locations, each describing accessibility in a different way, for example:

Aeshna's Schools Map, 0A [Done]
Keana's Libraries Map, 0B [Done]

1. A set of isochrones showing the area within each of a set of cutoff travel times.
- Aeshna's School Isochrone Map, 1A [Done]
- Keana's Library Isochrone Map, 1B [Done]

2. A set of points, polygons, or contours throughout the city with colors varying continuously to indicate the travel time from each point to the nearest location of interest.
- Aeshna's Cycling to School Map, 2A [Done]
- Keana's Cycling to Library Map, 2B [Done]

3. A set of points, polygons, or contours throughout the city with values varying continuously to indicate the number of locations of interest within a particular cutoff travel time.
- Aeshna's Schools Reachable by Cycling Map, 3A [Done]
- Alex's Libraries Reachable by Cycling Map, 3B [Done]

4. A set of points, polygons, or contours throughout the city with values varying continuously to indicate an accessibility score to locations of interest, based on a continuous decay function.
- Aeshna's Cycling to School Accessibility Score Map 4A [Done]
- Alex's Cycling to Library Accessibility Score Map 4B [Done]
- Aeshna's Four-Map Collection of Accessbility Rasterized 4

Or you could choose one or more of the above types of maps, and do the same analysis for each of multiple transportation modes (e.g. bicycle, walking, car, and transit).

At least two of your maps should illustrate accessibility using a raster layer.

Can I Bike to Learn?

The City of Detroit has long been known for its especially auto-dominated environment in both industry and in its built form. As the city tries to re-cast itself in a more equitable and environmentally-sustainable way, a focus on stronger neighborhood-level educational institutions and expansion of alternative transportation systems are necessary. 

Intrigued by this need, and coupling with Detroit's relatively flat geography, we took a closer look at the City's current cycling capabilities by mapping the relative accessibility of reaching a city school or city library. 

First, in plotting the city's schools and libraries, we see a general...

Next, we examined the

Finally, we tabulated an accessibility score to benchmark future progress on the development of this social infrastructure.

This was a joint project by Group (NUMBER). Keana Flores sourced the library information and plotted their locations and walking/biking travel times. Aeshea Prasad
